# Conti Cost Calulator Re-make

## Goal is to create a tool that can dynamically calculate the cost per mile of our tires vs. competitors and present it in a neat way to customers

- First step is to get calculations complete in python
- Set up a way to input data, maybe a web form?
- present data in either graph or table form
